### MISC

Moving this intro production, I would incorporate [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) or [date.fns](https://date-fns.org/) to handle
time-zones, as they can be notorious for complicating time conversion and daylight-savings time.

I would like to make this configurable in order to increase or decrease the amount of future games that are displayed
