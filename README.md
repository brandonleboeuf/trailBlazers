## Run Project

## Implementation

To implement, add the below code just above 'div class="panel-pane pane-custom pane-2"'
on the right rail of [blazers/forward-center](https://www.nba.com/blazers/forward-center)

```
<div class="panel-pane pane-custom pane-1">
  <div class="pane-content">
    <div class="center-block well">
      <iframe
        id="nextGame_iframe"
        src="https://trailblazers.netlify.app/"
        width="100%"
        height="485"
        frameborder="0"
        scrolling="no"
        title="Rip City NEXT_GAME"
      ></iframe>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

### Make It Production Ready

Moving this intro production, I would incorporate [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) or [date.fns](https://date-fns.org/) to handle
time-zones, as they can be notorious for complicating time conversion and daylight-savings time.

I would add a function to determine the start-end time of the game to change the button to say "LIVE" while the game is live.

I would like to make this configurable in order to increase or decrease the amount of future games that are displayed.
